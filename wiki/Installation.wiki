#summary How to install derv

= Requirements =

===Pirni, MobileTerminal, and the *derv* scripts can only be installed and run on _Jailbroken_ iPhones and iPod Touches!===

Other requirements for *derv*:
  * MobileTerminal
  * Pirni
  * root access 

The following applications _should_ be included in the installation of MobileTerminal and Pirni:
  * Bourne-Again SHell
  * grep
  * sed
  * libpcap
  * libnet

MobileTerminal and Pirni can both be installed using Cydia, Rock, or Icy.  Simply search for them and install.


= Installation =

Since *derv* is simply a few shell scripts, they only need to be copied to the device and executed using MobileTerminal.

If you already have [http://www.appleiphoneschool.com/openssh/ OpenSSH] installed on your device, you could copy the derv scripts using WinSCP, KiTTy, or some other SSH client.
Otherwise you could use [http://code.google.com/p/iphonebrowser/ iPhoneBrowser] to easily copy the files onto the device.

=== Step 1 : Copy the shell scripts to your device ===

My preferred location to copy the scripts to is: {{{
/private/var/mobile/
}}} Because MobileTerminal defaults to this directory on load.

The five scripts you need to copy are:
  * b4.sh
  * derv.sh
  * derv-pw.sh
  * derv-cookie.sh
  * derv-url.sh

Once these files are copied, you can exit iPhoneBrowser or the SSH client.

=== Step 2 : Execute the first script ===

Once these scripts are copied to the iPhone/iPod, we need to execute them.
From your iPhone/iPod's home screen, open MobileTerminal by tapping on it.
